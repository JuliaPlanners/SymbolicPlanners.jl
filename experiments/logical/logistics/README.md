# Logistics (STRIPS, Typed)

## Domain Description

Transport packages within cities via trucks, and between cities via airplanes.
Locations within a city are directly connected (trucks can move between any two such locations), and so are the cities.
In each city there is exactly one truck, each city has one location that serves as an airport.
