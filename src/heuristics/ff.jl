    FFHeuristic()

A relaxed planning graph heuristic introduced by the FastForward planner [1]. 
Similar to [`HSPHeuristic`](@ref), this heuristic precomputes a graph that
stores the dependencies between all ground actions and plan-relevant conditions.

To estimate the distance to the goal, a shortest-path search is performed in the
graph, starting from the conditions that are true in the current state, and 
ending when all the goal conditions are reached. Once a condition is achieved
by an action, it is considered to remain true through the rest of the search,
hence the relaxed nature of the heuristic. A plan that achieves the goal
conditions is reconstructed by following the action back-pointers for each
achieved condition, and the cost of this plan is used as the heuristic estimate.

This implementation supports domains with negative preconditions, disjunctive
preconditions (i.e., `or`, `exists`), and functional preconditions (e.g.
numeric comparisons, or other Boolean-valued functions of non-Boolean fluents).
Functional preconditions are handled by (optimistically) assuming they become
true once a constituent fluent is modified by some action.
